# What it is

This is a sample application that leverages [User Long Poll API](https://vk.com/dev/using_longpoll) from VK social network implemented in Haskell. Since there is no VK SDK for Haskell language, all the communication with VK API is done "manually" by sending the messages to VK REST API and parsing the results.

The application can receive the messages via Long Poll API whenever a user writes anything to your chat bot.
